# CUW Hackathon Fall 2023 sponsored by Aurora WDC! 

## Challenge overview

In this challenge, you will explore [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) which is based on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) ecosystem in order to create a decentralized social network.

### Regarding Bitcoins and Wallets: 

  - I have found that the app [BitPay](https://bitpay.com) will be beneficial for the purpose of testing
  - You can follow this [BitPay Tutorial](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015463612-How-to-Create-a-Testnet-Wallet) to get _test_ bitcoins/satoshis for dev

## Steps for this Hackathon

* Teams should fork this Repo and use it for submission
* We Expect to you to work _together_ instead of competing. This will create a _pair programming_ environment
* We anticipate there will be 2 Teams (Frontend and Backend) and 3 Team Leaders (Main Team Leader, Frontend Team Leader, Backend Team Leader)
* We expect the Main Team Leader to handle organization of teams and team member transfers, If any (i.e. If someone from the Frontend Team wanted to join the Backend)
* Subdivision of Frontend and Backend teams will be the responsibility of the 3 Team Leaders and to be based on preference & experience


## Prizes

* TBD
