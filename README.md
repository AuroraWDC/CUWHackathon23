# CUW Hackathon Fall 2023 sponsored by Aurora WDC! 

## Challenge Overview

Universities are largely irrelevant to their alumni. However, universities are working on all manner of difference-making "projects" in the world that alumni and those in their spheres of influence might be interested in funding with gifts, particularly If there was a recognition mechanism enabling those gifts to be seen by their peers or other funders. [Ordinals](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/bitcoin-ordinals-a-new-nft-collection-by-peter-schiff/), meanwhile, have emerged as Bitcoin's answer to Ethereum-based NFTs. 

On October 28, the CUW Hackathon Club will prototype a decentralized social network using the Nostr Protocol running on the Bitcoin ecosystem, enabling micro-payments (in "sats" or one-hundred-millionths of a Bitcoin token: 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC). Bitcoin is not yet recognized by the asset management universe as an investable asset class, but is likely to earn that regulatory status in 2024. (BlackRock is likely to win approval for a BTC ETF any week now, suggesting the biggest money in the world can now invest in BTC and enjoy the same benefits other asset classes might offer them.)

This is cutting edge engineering with innovations making development for Nostr faster, easier and better every day. [Nostr Testnet](https://nostrassets.medium.com/first-nostr-native-satoshi-testnet-for-taproot-assets-now-live-on-nostrassets-a0839fffc525)

Alumni and their monied peers across their spheres of influence will now have an easy way to donate BTC-denominated gifts to the projects they discover in this Nostr network to underwrite the work of whichever stakeholders have the best alignment (superiority criteria) with their interests (stake) and influence (power).

## Requirements

In this challenge, you will explore [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) which is based on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) ecosystem in order to create a decentralized social network for CUW Alumni. The Social network should include a _Page_ with sample projects that Alumni can _Donate To_ If it is interesting to them (i.e. has a button to Donate in Satoshis or Bitcoin).

### Sample Projects Provided by Concordia:

* [New Engineering Program](https://blog.cuw.edu/kumpaty-engineering-chair/)
* [Interprofessional Clinic](https://blog.cuw.edu/serving-the-students-and-serving-the-community-through-physical-therapy/)
* [Aquaponics](https://blog.cuw.edu/tmj4-concordias-aquaponics-system-produces-year-round-vegetation/)

### Regarding Bitcoins and Wallets: 

  - I have found that the app [BitPay](https://bitpay.com) will be beneficial for the purpose of testing
  - You can follow this [BitPay Tutorial](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015463612-How-to-Create-a-Testnet-Wallet) to get _test_ bitcoins/satoshis for dev

### Steps for this Hackathon

* Teams should fork this Repo and use it for submission
* We Expect to you to work _together_ instead of competing. This will create a _pair programming_ environment
* We anticipate there will be 2 Teams (Frontend and Backend) and 3 Team Leaders (Main Team Leader, Frontend Team Leader, Backend Team Leader)
* We expect the Main Team Leader to handle organization of teams and team member transfers, If any (i.e. If someone from the Frontend Team wanted to join the Backend)
* Subdivision of Frontend and Backend teams will be the responsibility of the 3 Team Leaders and to be based on preference & experience
